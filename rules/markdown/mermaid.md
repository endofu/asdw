# Mermaid diagrams in markdown files

Use mermaid diagrams whereever you can. They communicate structures, architectures, processes, journeys and other systems very well.

## Rules for mermaid diagrams

- Always put the names and title in `"`  double quotes
- Always escape out special characters in Strings (names, titles)
